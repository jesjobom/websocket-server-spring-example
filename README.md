# Example of a Websocket Server using Spring's Websocket API + SocksJS + Stomp
This is a websocket server using Spring's API with a JSP for testing.
The main idea here is to explore some of the Stomp's capabilities by defining "channels" for different users or uses over the same socket.
Later, I'll publish a websocket client also using Spring's API.
